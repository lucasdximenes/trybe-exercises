---

## Exercise

### [Exercise 1](./exercise_1/)

1. Add a CSS framework of your choice to the form you built in the last exercise and use it to style the form.

> ## Bonus

1. Add a date picker JavaScript library to the form you built in the last class. Use this library in the "Start date" field of the form. You can remove the date validations you added, as the library will take care of allowing only valid dates.

2. Add a JavaScript library of validations to the form you built in the last class. Use this library to override the validations you did manually.
