# Welcome to the ES6 project repository and Unit Tests!

Here you will find the details of the unit testing project, developed by [Lucas Ximenes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasdximenes/).

<details>
  <summary><strong>üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed</strong></summary><br />

Several functions were implemented in the resolution of the proposed requirements and unit tests to ensure that the implementations of the functions are correct, according to what was requested in each statement.

In this project, it was developed:

- Unit tests using the NodeJS Jest module to verify the correct functioning of the functions;
- Functions so that they meet already implemented tests;
- Tests and functions using a test driven development (TDD) approach.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>‚ÄºÔ∏è Before you start developing</strong></summary><br />

1. Clone the repository

- `git clone git@github.com:lucasdximenes/js-unit-tests.git`.
- Enter the repository folder you just cloned:
  - `cd js-unit-tests`

2. Install dependencies

- `npm install`

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üõ† Tests</strong></summary><br />

All project requirements will be tested **automatically** through `Jest`.

- The commands you will use most often are:

  - `npm test` (runs all tests present in the application)
  - `npm test path/to/file` (runs only tests present in the specified file)
  - Example: `npm test tests/average.spec.js`

</details>

# Mandatory requirements

### 1. Implement the `average` function

<details>
  <summary>The average function takes a variable-length array and returns the average of the values ‚Äã‚Äãreceived. If the function receives some non-numeric value or an empty array, the value `undefined` must be returned.</summary><br/>
  
  All results must be rounded to integers. Ex: 4.6 becomes 5; 1.3 becomes 1. The `average.spec.js` file contains the tests for `average` already implemented. Implement the function in the `src/average.js` file so that it meets the proposed tests.

**What will be tested:**

- It will be validated if, when receiving an array of numbers, the `average` function returns the average of its values;
- It will be validated if, when receiving an array that contains non-numeric values, the `average` function returns `undefined`;
- It will be validated if, when receiving an empty array, the `average` function returns `undefined`.

</details>

---

### 2. Implement the test cases for the `numbers` function

<details>
  <summary>The `numbers` function takes a variable-length array and returns `true` if all parameters are of type 'number' and `false` otherwise.</summary><br/>
  
  This function is already implemented in the `src/numbers.js` file. Write at least four tests for this function to ensure that the implementation of `numbers` is correct.

**What will be tested:**

- It will be validated if in the test of the `numbers` function, the function return is `true` when the array passed by parameter contains only numbers.

</details>

---

### 3. Implement the `vqv` function

<details>
  <summary>Use template literals to write a function that takes its name and age and returns the paragraph described below:</summary><br/>

```javascript
`Hi, my name is Tunico!
I'm 30 years old,
I work at Trybe and I do a lot of programming!
#VQV!`;
```

If the function is called without any parameters, the value `undefined` must be returned. The `vqv.spec.js` file contains the tests for `vqv` already implemented. Implement the function in the `src/vqv.js` file so that it meets the proposed tests.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if `vqv` is a function;
- It will be validated if the `vqv` function returns string data;
- It will be validated if the `vqv` function returns the expected phrase when passed parameters of name and age;
- It will be validated if the `vqv` function, when called without parameter, returns `undefined`.

</details>

---

### 4. Implement the test cases for the `circle` function

<details>

  <summary>The `circle` function receives the radius of a circle and returns an object containing its information: Radius, Area and Circumference. If no radius is specified, the function returns `undefined`.</summary></br>
  
  This function is already implemented in the `src/circle.js` file. Write at least six tests for this function to ensure that the `circle` implementation is correct.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if in the test of the `circle` function, when receiving a radius, the function return is an object with the correct information (Radius, Area and Circumference).

</details>

---

### 5. Implement the `createStudent` function

<details>
<summary>The `createStudent` function takes as a parameter a **name**, and returns an object containing two keys:</summary></br>

1. **name**, containing the name passed as a parameter;
2. **feedback**, containing a function that returns the phrase 'Jeez good person!' when being called.

The `createStudent.spec.js` file contains the tests for ra `createStudent` already implemented. Implement the function in the `src/createStudent.js` file so that it meets the proposed tests.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if the `createStudent` function returns an object that contains two keys: `name`, containing the name passed as a parameter; and `feedback`, containing a function that returns the phrase 'Jeez good person!' when being called.

</details>

---

### 6. Implement the test cases for the `productDetails` function

<details>
  <summary>The `productDetails` function takes two strings representing product names, and returns an array containing two objects with the details of the respective products:</summary></br>

```javascript
productDetails("Alcohol gel", "Mask");
```

**Returns:**

```js
[
  {
    name: 'Alcohol gel'
    details: {
      productId: 'Alcohol gel123'
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Mask'
    details: {
      productId: 'Mask123'
    }
  }
]
```

This function is already implemented in the `src/productDetails.js` file. Write at least five tests for this function in the `tests/productDetails.js` file to ensure that the `productDetails` implementation is correct.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if in the test of the `productDetails` function, when receiving two strings, the function return is an array of objects and if each object contains the necessary data.

</details>

---

### 7. Implement the `calculator` and `arrayGenerator` functions

<details>
  <summary>The `calculator` function takes two integers as a parameter and returns an object with the following braces:</summary></br>
  - sum;
  - multi;
  - div;
  - sub.

For each key, assign the corresponding operation to its key as a value:

- `sum:` returns the result of the sum of the two numbers;
- `mult:` returns the result of multiplying the two numbers;
- `div:` returns the result of dividing the two numbers;
- `sub:` returns the result of subtracting the two numbers.

Division results should always be rounded down.

Parameters:

- Two whole numbers.

Behavior:

```javascript
calculator(1, 2); // { sum: 3, mult: 2, div: 0, sub: -1 }
```

The `arrayGenerator` function converts objects into arrays, of keys, values ‚Äã‚Äãor both. It must take two parameters:

- the first parameter must be a string that indicates the type of conversion;
- the second parameter should be an object similar to the one returned by the calculator function you just developed.

Parameters:

- A string indicating the type of conversion;
- An object in the format { sum: 3, mult: 2, div: 0, sub: -1 };

Behavior:

```javascript
arrayGenerator("keys", { sum: 3, mult: 2, div: 1, sub: 0 ‚Äã‚Äã}); // [ 'sum', 'mult', 'div', 'sub' ]
arrayGenerator("values", { sum: 3, mult: 2, div: 1, sub: 0 ‚Äã‚Äã}); // [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]
arrayGenerator("entries", { sum: 3, mult: 2, div: 1, sub: 0 ‚Äã‚Äã}); // [ [ 'sum', 3 ], [ 'mult', 2 ], [ 'div', 1 ], [ 'sub', 0 ] ]
```

The `objPlayground.spec.js` file contains the tests for `calculator` and `arrayGenerator` already implemented. Implement the functions in the `src/objPlayground.js` file so that it meets the proposed tests.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be evaluated if the `calculator` function returns the expected values;
- It will be evaluated if the `arrayGenerator` function returns the expected values.

</details>

### 8. Implement the `myCounter` function

<details>
  <summary>The myCounter function has two nested loops that insert values ‚Äã‚Äãinto an array. As we can see, they add values ‚Äã‚Äãto the array until its stop condition.</summary></br>

Fix the `myCounter` function, without eliminating any of the repeat loops, so that the function returns the correct array. The `myCounter.spec.js` file contains the tests for `myCounter` already implemented. Implement the function in the `src/myCounter.js` file so that it meets the proposed tests.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if the `myCounter` function returns the expected data according to what is implemented in the test.

</details>

---

### 9. Implement the test cases for the `getCharacter` function

<details>

  <summary>The `getCharacter` function takes a string representing the name of a character and returns an object containing its name, its class and its phrases.</summary></br>

```javascript
getCharacter("Arya");
```

**Returns:**

```javascript
{
  name: 'Arya Stark',
  class: 'Rogue',
  phrases: ['Not today', 'A girl has no name.']
}
```

This function is already implemented in the `src/getCharacter.js` file. Write at least six tests for this function in the `tests/getCharacter.spec.js` file to ensure that the implementation of `getCharacter` is correct.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if, in the test of the `getCharacter` function, when receiving a string, the function return is as expected - according to the table presented in the test file.
- It will be validated if in the test of the `getCharacter` function, when not receiving any parameter, the function return is `undefined`.
- It will be validated if the test and the `getCharacter` function checks if the parameter is case sensitive.

</details>

### 10. Implement the `createMenu` function as well as your test cases

<details>
  <summary>This last requirement will guide you through a rich process of Test Driven Development or TDD - Test Driven Development</summary></br>

Imagine the following situation: you are responsible for writing the code for a restaurant's ordering system through which it will be possible to register a menu. Once a menu has been registered, the system must provide an object that allows:

- Read the registered menu;
- Place orders;
- Check what was requested;
- Add the value of the account.

The structure of this code and this object is already defined and you need to implement it. You will find more details about the structure to follow and examples of the function return in the `src/restaurant.js` file.
You will have to guide yourself through the topics below to guarantee the good development of the system.

**IMPORTANT - GOOD TDD PRACTICES: START WITH TEST 1 IN THE `tests/restaurant.spec.js` FILE**

1. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks if the `createMenu()` function returns an object that has the `fetchMenu` key, which has a function value.

2. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks if `'ReturnObject.fetchMenu()'` returns an object whose keys are only `food` and `drink`, whereas the `createMenu ()` was called with the object: `{ food: {}, drink: {} }`.

3. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks whether the menu passed to the `createMenu()` function is identical to the menu retrieved by the `'ReturnObject.fetchMenu()'` function.

4. In the `src/restaurant.js` file, create a `createMenu()` function that, taking an object as a parameter, returns this object with the following format: { fetchMenu: () =>ObjectPassedByParameter }.

5. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks if `'Returnedobject.consumption'`, after creating the menu, returns an empty array.

6. In the `src/restaurant.js` file, add to the object returned by `createMenu()` a `consumption` key which, as an initial value, has an empty array.

7. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks if when calling a function associated with the `order` key in the returned object, passing a string as a parameter (such as `objetoRetornado.order('coxinha') `), that string is added to the array returned in `ObjectReturned.consumption`.

8. In the `src/restaurant.js` file, create a function, separate from the `createMenu()` function, which, upon receiving a string as a parameter, adds this string to the `Returnedobject.consumption` array. This new function will be added to the `order` key.

9. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks if when adding three orders, among drinks and food, the `ObjectReturned.consumption` array contains the ordered items.

10. In the `tests/restaurant.spec.js` file, write a test that checks whether the `order` function accepts repeated orders being added to `consumption`.

11. In the file `tests/restaurant.spec.js`, write a test that verifies that, when calling `objectRetornado.pay()`, it returns the sum of the prices of everything that was ordered, as recorded in `objetoRetornado.consumption`.

12. In the `src/restaurant.js` file, add to the object returned by `createMenu()` a `pay` key with a function that loops through all the items in `Retornado.consumption`, sums their price and returns the added value plus 10%. TIP: For this you will need to loop through both the `food` key object and the `drink` key object.

**What will be evaluated**

- It will be validated if the `createMenu()` function returns the expected data.
- It will be validated if the test of the `createMenu()` function checks each one of the function's returns and if these returns have the expected behavior.
