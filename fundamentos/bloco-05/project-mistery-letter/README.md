- All words must contain one class from each group.
- That is, if you use the `magazine1`, `big`, `rotateleft` and `skewright` classes in a word, the other classes of each group should not be used for that same word. For example, the `newspaper` and `magazine2` classes would not be used from the style group because the `magazine1` class is already being used.
