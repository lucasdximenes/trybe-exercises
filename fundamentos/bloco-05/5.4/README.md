[Exercise 1](./exercise_1/)

> Imagine that you are the person responsible for developing a page that will serve as a reader for written content.
> This demand requires you to apply your readers' preferences on the page to improve their reading experience.

1. People must have the power to change:
   - Screen background color;
   - Text color;
   - Font size;
   - Spacing between text lines;
   - Font type (Font family).
   - These preferences must be saved so that, when returning to the page, the preferences that were previously configured can be applied on the screen.
