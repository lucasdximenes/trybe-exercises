# JavaScript - DOM and selectors

---

## Part II - Element selectors

### [Exercise 1](./exercise_1/)

1. Retrieve the element that contains the page title and do something with it, like change it to the name of your favorite movie.
2. Now retrieve the second paragraph and use your creativity to change it.
3. Finally, retrieve the subtitle and change it as well.

### [Exercise 2](./exercise_2/)

1. Add an equal class to the two paragraphs.
2. Retrieve your paragraphs via JavaScript code, using the getElementsByClassName function;
3. Change some style of the first one.
4. Retrieve the subtitle and change its color using the getElementsByTagName function.

## Part III - Element Selectors

### [Exercise 1](./exercise_3/)

-   For practice, replace all the functions you used in the previous exercise with `querySelector` and/or `querySelectorAll`.

### [Exercise 2](./exercise_4/)

-   In addition, we will consolidate the handling of HTML elements, placing the color of the Trybe Time Manager as in the image below using only JavaScript!

> You'll need to use what you've learned about getElementBy and querySelector to put it into practice.

## DOM manipulation functions

### [Exercise 1](./exercise_5/)

-   Here you will modify the existing elements using only the functions:
    -   document.getElementById()
    -   document.getElementsByClassName()
    -   document.getElementsByTagName()

1. Create a function that changes the text in the `<p>` tag to a description of how you see yourself in 2 years. (Don't spend time thinking about the text, but doing the exercise)
2. Create a function that changes the color of the yellow square to the green of Trybe `(rgb(76,164,109))`.
3. Create a function that changes the color of the red square to white.
4. Create a function that corrects the text of the `<h1>` tag.
5. Create a function that changes all text in the `<p>` tag to uppercase.
6. Create a function that displays the contents of all `<p>` tags in the console.
