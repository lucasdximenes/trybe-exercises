# JavaScript - Programming Logic and Algorithms

---

## [Exercise 1](./exercise_1/script.js)

1. Create an algorithm that returns the factorial of 10.

---

## [Exercise 2](./exercise_2/script.js)

2. Develop an algorithm that is capable of inverting a word. For example, the word "banana" would be inverted to "ananab". Use the string below as an example, then change it to others to check if your algorithm is working correctly.

---

## [Exercise 3](./exercise_3/script.js)

3. Consider the array of strings below:

```
let array = ['java', 'javascript', 'python', 'html', 'css'];
```

-   Write two algorithms: one that returns the largest word in this array and another that returns the smallest. Consider the number of characters in each word.

---

## [Exercise 4](./exercise_4/script.js)

4. write an algorithm that returns the largest prime number between 0 and 50.

---

## [Exercise 5](./exercise_5/script.js)

5. Write a program that, given any value `n`, be `n > 1`, prints on the screen a square made of asterisks of size `n`. For example:

```
n = 5

*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
```

---

## [Exercise 6](./exercise_6/script.js)

6. For the sixth exercise, do the same as before, but print a right triangle with `5` base asterisks. For example:

```
n = 5

*
**
***
****
*****
```

---

## [Exercise 7](./exercise_7/script.js)

7. Now invert the side of the triangle. For example:

```
n = 5

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
```

---

## [Exercise 8](./exercise_8/script.js)

8. Next, make a pyramid with `n` base asterisks:

```
n = 5

  *
 ***
*****
```

---

## [Exercise 9](./exercise_9/script.js)

9. Make a pyramid with `n` base asterisks that is empty in the middle. Assume that the value of `n` will always be odd:

```
Finally, let's make the variable increment with the value corresponding to each loop;
n = 7

   *
  * *
 * *
*******
```

---

## [Exercise 10](./exercise_10/script.js)

10. Write a program that tells whether a number defined in a variable is prime or not.
