Consider that the coverage of the paint is 1 liter for every 3 square meters and
that the paint is sold in 18 liter cans, which cost R$80.00. Create a function
that returns two values in a tuple containing the amount of paint cans to be
purchased and the total price based on the size of a wall (in mÂ²).
