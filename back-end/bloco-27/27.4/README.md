# SOLID - Introduction to S.O and D principles

---

## [Exercise](./exercise/)

This application is an example refactored with S.O and D principles.

- S = Single Responsibility Principle - is a principle that says that a class should have only one responsibility and that responsibility should be fully encapsulated by the class.

- O = Open Closed Principle - is a principle that says that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- D = Dependency Inversion Principle - is a principle that says that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both must rely on abstractions.
